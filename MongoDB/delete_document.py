'''
Delete Document
To delete one document, we use the delete_one() method.
The first parameter of the delete_one() method is a query object defining which document to delete.
'''
# Delete the document with the address "Mountain 21":
import pymongo

myclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mydb = myclient["mydatabase"]
mycol = mydb["customers"]

myquery = { "address": "Mountain 21" }

mycol.delete_one(myquery)

'''
Delete Many Documents
To delete more than one document, use the delete_many() method.
The first parameter of the delete_many() method is a query object defining which documents to delete.
'''
# Delete all documents were the address starts with the letter S:
import pymongo

myclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mydb = myclient["mydatabase"]
mycol = mydb["customers"]

myquery = { "address": {"$regex": "^S"} }

x = mycol.delete_many(myquery)

print(x.deleted_count, " documents deleted.")

# Delete all documents in the "customers" collection:
import pymongo

myclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mydb = myclient["mydatabase"]
mycol = mydb["customers"]

x = mycol.delete_many({})

print(x.deleted_count, " documents deleted.")
