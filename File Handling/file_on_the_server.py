Open a File on the Server
Assume we have the following file, located in the same folder as Python:

demofile.txt
Hello! Welcome to demofile.txt
This file is for testing purposes.
Good Luck!

To open the file, use the built-in open() function.
The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:
'''
f = open("demofile.txt")
print(f.read())

# If the file is located in a different location, you will have to specify the file path, like this:
# Open a file on a different location:
# f = open("D:\\myfiles\welcome.txt")
print(f.read())

# You can also use the with statement when opening a file:
# Using the with keyword:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

'''
Close Files
It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.
If you are not using the with statement, you must write a close statement in order to close the file:
'''
# Close the file when you are finished with it:
f = open("demofile.txt")
print(f.readline())
f.close()

# By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:
# Return the 5 first characters of the file:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read(5))

# You can return one line by using the readline() method:
# Read one line of the file:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.readline())

# Read two lines of the file:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.readline())
  print(f.readline())

# Loop through the file line by line:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  for x in f:
    print(x)
